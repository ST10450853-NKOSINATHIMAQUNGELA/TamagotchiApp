The app is designed for the user to interact with the virtual pet called Rocky. In doing so, the pets's statuses alternate according to how the user interacted with it.

To use the app you first need to:
1) Run the application
2) press the get started button to be redirected to the second page
3) press the appropriate button on the second page to interact with the virtual pet
4) Have fun whilst playing with your new pet :)
